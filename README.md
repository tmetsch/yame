# Yet Another Markdown Editor

I hacked this together mostly for personal use, so it is far from perfect!
But feel free to fork and extend :-)

This editor features:

* All features a good editor should have: copy, paste, save file, open file,
...
* GUI with side-to-side edit and preview panel
* Spell checking
* A Tree view which shows the document structure
* Support for MultiMarkdown to get Maths, Tabels etc. working
* Export of HTML

Requirements:

* [PySide](http://www.pyside.org/) (GUI)
* [PyEnchant](http://packages.python.org/pyenchant/) (Spellchecking)
* [MultiMarkdown](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/) or any other Markdown parser
